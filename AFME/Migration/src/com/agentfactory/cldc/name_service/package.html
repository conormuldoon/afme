<body>This package provides the functionality for unique naming in AFME. Unique
naming becomes an issue when migration is supported. With migration, an
agent can no longer be identified through a combination of its local name and
address since its address will change. It must be ensure that if an agent 
migrates to a platform, there are no agents at the destination with
the same name. With unique naming, the developer is assured that the agent
will receive a globally unique name.</body>
